"""
Best-effort SENS announcements + news fetching.

There is no free official JSE SENS API, so SENS headlines are scraped from
Sharenet's public (no-login) SENS pages, and news is pulled from Google
News' public RSS search feed. Both are wrapped so a layout change or a
network hiccup degrades to an empty result with a message, never a crash.

NOTE: like src/data.py, this was written in a sandboxed dev environment
with no route to either sharenet.co.za or news.google.com, so it could not
be exercised against live traffic during development -- the HTML/RSS
parsing logic follows the structure observed via web research at build
time (September 2026). Run `python3 scripts/test_sens_connection.py` on
your machine to confirm both sources still work, and see that script's
docstring for what to do if Sharenet's markup has since changed.

    raises) if the page can't be reached or parsed.

    NOTE: the per-company filter param is "scode" (verified against
    Sharenet's live site -- e.g. sens.php?scode=SHP correctly returns only
    Shoprite's own announcements). An earlier version of this function sent
    "sharecode" instead, which Sharenet silently ignores as an unrecognised
    parameter, so it fell back to the full market-wide feed for every
    stock -- meaning every page using this (Event Study, SENS & News) was
    scoring/displaying announcements for random unrelated JSE companies
    rather than the selected stock's own news. Also worth knowing: without
    a MySharenet subscription, the live site only exposes a handful of a
    company's most recent announcements (it's paywalled beyond that), so
    even correctly filtered results may be sparse for a quiet stock or a
    long lookback window -- that's a source limitation, not a bug here.
